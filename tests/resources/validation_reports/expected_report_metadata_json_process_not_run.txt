-
VCF VALIDATION RESULTS
Checks whether each file is compliant with the VCF specification (http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.4.pdf).
Also checks whether the variants' reference alleles match against the reference assembly.

-
REFERENCE GENOME INSDC CHECK
Checks that the reference sequences in the FASTA file used to call the variants are accessioned in INSDC.
Also checks if the reference assembly accession in the metadata matches the one determined from the FASTA file.
